    Display File Contents: To display the contents of a single file, you can use the cat command followed by the file name:

    - cat filename
    This will print the contents of the file to the terminal.

    Concatenate Files: You can use cat to concatenate multiple files together and display the combined contents:

    - cat file1 file2 file3
    This will concatenate the contents of file1, file2, and file3 and display them in the terminal.

    Create or Append to a File: By using output redirection, you can create a new file or append to an existing file using cat:

    - cat > newfile.txt
    This will create a new file named newfile.txt and allow you to enter text from the terminal. Press Ctrl + D to save the content.

    To append to an existing file, you can use the >> operator:

    - cat >> existingfile.txt
    This will append the content entered from the terminal to the end of existingfile.txt.
